first two chars should be #! 
#! bin/bash 
# #! passes the path to the origin program as a command line arg 
env will look for bash in your path 
exec perm with chmod u+x - u  user x executable perm
ie chmod +x file.sh 
if the scrupt is not in curent dir, run like this ./file.sh 
other wise bash file.bash 
time command is built in 
real - watch 
user - cpu 
sys - cpu 

var are assigned with = 
specail chars should be quoted 
remove unset 
export command 

you can export and asign vals
export var2="var2 value" #do not leave spaces before of after = when delcaring

export -f myfunc 

a =1 ( a = 2) echo $a 
#prints 1 
a = 1 { a = 2 }
echo $a 
#prints 2
